# Major-project-Teachnook
In this Project, we will make an E-commerce website using Html, Css and JavaScript with Source Code.
An online store called an e-commerce website lets you buy and sell different things over the Internet. The structure and content of our E-Commerce Website are created using HTML. Our goal should be to win our users’ hearts. To do it, we employ CSS. CSS enables us to use a variety of colours, fonts, and layouts to make our website visually appealing. Our e-commerce store will get some new features, and we’ll use some JavaScript ideas to make that happen
This webpage responds to all device sizes. When a website is fully responsive, it may be viewed on any website and will adapt its content to the device being used to view it.
There are three main sections on any web page: the header, the body, and the footer. Simply said, we adjust the text between the HTML tags according to each section
The <“div class=”header”> tag is used to carry either an introduction or a group of navigational links. Only the largest blocks of navigation links are covered by the <nav> tag.
The <img> tag is used to embed images on HTML pages.To specify the path to the image, we use “src”. I want my website’s logo to appear here. I must particularly acknowledge that in order to implement CSS functions. I’ve created a class called “logo” just for that purpose.
Additionally, we added an image to our header’s background and the toggle image by using the <img> tag.
An unordered list is defined using the <ul> tag. The <li> tag marks the beginning of the list item.
To link to websites or anything else that a URL can address, we utilise the <a> tag and its “href” attribute. The target of the link should be specified in the <a> tags. The div tag is used to group HTML elements together. I’ve created a div class here named “intro.” The <h1> and <h3> tags specify the headings.
There are three techniques to include CSS in HTML texts. These are internal, external, and inline CSS. I’ve utilised an external CSS file in this case. HTML components having a specific class attribute are chosen using the class selector.
We inserted padding and margin as “zero” here using the global selector. The box is “border-box” in size.
We set the item inside it to be posted at the “centre” and its display to be “flex” using the class selector (.navbar). Its padding was similarly set to “20 px.” We style the paragraph, list item, anchor tag, and unorder list solely utilising the nav bar and the elements inside of it. Just now, we incorporated the style
f you’re wondering how we generated this “explore now” button, we first created a hyperlink tag using the <a> anchor tag with a class named (.btn). We have now added the border radius and background colour to our button using this (.btn) class.
We used the images to build the body section, and the paragraph tag is being used for the content. Additionally, we added icons from the typeface Awesome to the body section’s text. In this part, you may find some shopping photographs with product descriptions. To highlight the new clothes, we have also created a featured section to our body.
As you can see, we simply added styling to our body section using the class selector. The top and bottom margins have been added as “70px” using the.categories class, first. Our section has been divided into columns, thus we will use the column class to add the width and height to the content in those classes.
We have created a section with the div class “footer” defined. The <ul> tag was used to construct an unordered list. I use the <li> tag to begin the list item. To link to online pages, we employ the <a> tag and its “href” attribute. The target of the link should be specified in the <a> tag. Another div class called “social-links” has been defined. The font-awesome icons have been imported. We also inserted an image of our website’s logo to the footer within the <img> tag.
We have included the footer style in this. You only need to read through the code once to understand how we formatted our footer. The media query was utilised to provide responsiveness to our website, which is now the most crucial aspect. As the size reduces, we added a condition to the maximum width, and the content size adjusts in line with the window size.
